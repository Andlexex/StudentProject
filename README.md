# StudentProject
Student project about GNN.
This repository should soon contain the following:
- A topic
- Some code (e.g. Python3)
- Some datasets (e.g. MovieLens)
- Some presentations about GNNs, datasets, benchmarks, papers
- Maybe some latex files

The general aim is to somehow improve the x for x in {scalability and efficiency, expressiveness, over-smoothness, robustness, cold-start} of GNNs
